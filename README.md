This vimrc is primarily built for writing and organizing plain text.

The vimrc contains the following features:
  * built to have a separate configuration for each filetype.
  * easier handling of files and buffers.
  * enables a personal wiki with markdown inside of Vim.
  * boosts markdown editing with (simple) autocompletion and snippets.
  * toggles a distraction-free environment.
