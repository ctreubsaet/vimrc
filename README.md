This vimrc is primarily built for writing plain text and light scripting.

The vimrc contains the following features:
  * checks if the necessary packages are installed.
  * automatically installs plug.vim and the plugins.
  * uses FZF for easier handling of files and buffers.
  * uses ALE for linting and code formatting while you edit your text files.
  * uses UltiSnips for snippets management and vim-snippets for community snippets.
  * uses Goyo and Limelight to toggle a distraction-free environment.
