This vimrc is primarily built for writing plain text and light scripting.

The vimrc contains the following features:
  * check if the necessary packages are installed.
  * automatically installs plug.vim and plugins.
  * uses FZF for easier handling of files and buffers.
  * uses Goyo and Limelight to toggle a distraction-free environment.
